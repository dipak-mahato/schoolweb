<p>Birendra Multiple Campus that we see it today in its form and features, was established on the 1st Baishakh, 2022 BS. as 'Birendra Intermediate Arts College', named after late King Birendra, with the initiation and efforts of academicians, social workers, guardians, donors and local institutions feeling the need of an academic institution of higher education for the growing population of the district after Chitwan was open for settlement in 2011. With many ups and downs on its course of growth, the college received 10 Bighas of land from HMG in 2028 and in 2032 the college shifted to its own building which was inaugurated by  Late Ling Birendra on 6th Marg, 2034B.S. The college then was capable enough to begin Bachelor level which was materialized in 2035. From 2040, The college started I.Sc. and became the first multiple campus in Chitwan district. The college was expanding physically and academically day by day. In this context the college took a great stride in its academic activity and began Masters Level in Economics in 2045, B.Sc. in 2050, M.A. (Nepali) in 2053 and since then different programmes of Bachelor and Master's Levels began to be added one after another without any interruption.</p>  
<p>The Journey of this campus that began in 2022 has become a model journey of an academic institution of its kind. In its long course up to now it has been able to enlighten many individuals of different corners of the nation and thus illuminate the whole society with the knowledge, skills and inspiration.
We hope, in the days to come, this college will not lag behind to academically lead the society imparting quality education to meet the demands of 21st century.</p> 
<p>We express our sincere gratitude to those who directly or indirectly contributed to the birth growth and development of this campus and brought in to the present strength and shape.
